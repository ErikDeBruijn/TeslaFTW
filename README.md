TeslaFTW
========

Pebble App to control your Tesla Model S/X or hopefully soon the model E (economy).

It uses the Tesla API. To control your Tesla. It will allow you to do things like the following:

 - Turn on/off A/C (or car pre-heating in winter)
 - See indoor and outdoor temperature
 - Start/stop charging
 - See battery status, possible range and charge rate + cost information
 - Lock your car
 - Honk the horn
 - Flash the lights

The functions are ordered so that the menu's at the top are the things I use most. It will automatically start retrieving charge info once opened.
